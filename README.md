Description:
Here is my final project for object oriented programing. The topic was: marriage. So I desided to make a simple application for generating invitations for a wedding.
You just have to fill in Bride's, Groom's, Guest's names, add information about location and date of the wedding and choose one of the templates (there're 2 of it).
When you click generate it creates in the directory main/invites invitations in .jpg format for all of the guests

The interface here is a simple command line but I think it's more than enough, I tried to make it as clear as possible.

Languages:
* python 3.12

To start the program: 
1)download repo
2)open menu.py and start it (it's in main/utils dir)

Tests:
used PYTEST here, unit tests are it the "tests" dir.


It was a pleasure working on this project, I enjoyed it so much!
